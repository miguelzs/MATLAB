I guess you're right, Plankton.
I am just a kid.
And you know,
I've been through a lot
in the past six days,
five minutes,
twenty-seven-and-a-half seconds.
And if I've learned anything during that time,
...or managerial promotion...
...or some other third thing...
can make me anything more than what I really am inside:
A kid.
I made it to Shell City,
and I beat the Cyclops,
and I rode the Hasselhoff,
and I brought the crown back.
So, yeah, I'm a kid.
And I'm also a goofball.
And a wing nut.
And a Knucklehead McSpazatron!
But most of all, I'm...
I'm...
I'm...
