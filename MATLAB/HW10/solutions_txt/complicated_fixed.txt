Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take, what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no no
