Did you ever hear
The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?
I thought not.
It's not a story the
Darth Plagueis
was a Dark Lord of the Sith,
so powerful and so wise
He had such a knowledge of the dark side
that he could even keep the ones he cared about
from dying.
The dark side of the Force
is a pathway to many abilities
some consider to be unnatural.
He became so powerful...
the only thing he was afraid of
was losing his power,
which eventually,
of course, he did.
Unfortunately,
he taught his apprentice everything he knew,
then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
It's ironic.
He could save others from death,
but not himself.
