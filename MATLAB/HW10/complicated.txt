Why'd you BEEP to go and make BEEP so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this, BEEP
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
BEEP you take, what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, BEEP no
