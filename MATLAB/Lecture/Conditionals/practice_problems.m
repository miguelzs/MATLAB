%% PRACTICE PROBLEMS
%% THESE ARE NOT TO BE TURNED IN.  THEY ARE ONLY TO HELP YOU PRACTICE YOUR
%% PROBLEM SOLVING AND CODING SKILS FOR VECTORS, CONDITIONALS AND
%% ITERATIONS


%% PROBLEM 1)
%% Write a script that starts like this...
clear
clc

classGrades = [90 45 67 89 72];

%% and looks at eachgrade in the vector classGrades and shows its letter grade
%% as indicated by...
%% A >= 90, B >=80, C >= 70, D >= 60, F < 60
%% Do this three times, 
%% Once using a for loop that indexes each element in the vector; 
%% Once using a for loop that sets the loop control variable equal to each element in the vector
%% Once using a while loop


%% PROBLEM 2)
%% Write a script that starts like this ...
clear
clc

months = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12];

%% and looks at each month in the vector months and shows the number of days in
%% the month.
%% Do this three times, 
%% Once using a for loop that indexes each element in the vector; 
%% Once using a for loop that sets the loop control variable equal to each element in the vector
%% Once using a while loop


%% PROBLEM 3)
%% Write a script that starts like this...
clear
clc

modelYears = round(rand(1,5)*10) + 1998;

%% This is a randomly generated vector representing the automotive model
%% years of five cars.  The earliest model year is 1998.  The latest is
%% 2008. Your scrit should show the cost of each car's tag based on the
%% following table...

%% For 1998-1999 the tag cost is $10
%% For even year cars, the tag cost is $50
%% For odd year cars, the tag cost is $75
%% For leap year tags, the cost reduced by half
%% Do this three times, 
%% Once using a for loop that indexes each element in the vector; 
%% Once using a for loop that sets the loop control variable equal to each element in the vector
%% Once using a while loop
