I guess you're right, Plankton.
five minutes,
twenty-seven-and-a-half seconds.
And if I've learned anything during that time,
It's that you are who you are.
And no amount of mermaid magic...
...or managerial promotion...
...or some other third thing...
can make me anything more than what I really am inside:
A kid.
But that's okay!
Because I did what everyone said a kid couldn't do.
I made it to Shell City,
and I rode the Hasselhoff,
and I brought the crown back.
So, yeah, I'm a kid.
And I'm also a goofball.
I'm...
I'm...
I'm a goofy goober! (Rock!)
