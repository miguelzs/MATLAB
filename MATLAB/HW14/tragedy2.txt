The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?
I thought not.
It's not a story the
Jedi would tell you.
It's a Sith legend.
Darth Plagueis
was a Dark Lord of the Sith,
so powerful and so wise
he could use the Force
to influence the midichlorians to create life...
He had such a knowledge of the dark side
some consider to be unnatural.
He became so powerful...
the only thing he was afraid of
was losing his power,
which eventually,
of course, he did.
Unfortunately,
but not himself.
